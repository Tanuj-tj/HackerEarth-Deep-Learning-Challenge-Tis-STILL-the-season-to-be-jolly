> Used differnet transfer learning techniques to train the data

| MODELS            | ACCURACY(%) |
| ---               | ---         |
| MobileNetV2       | 88.40 %     |
| InceptionV3       | 89.92 %     |
| VGG16             | 77.64 %     |
| ResNet            | 86.60 %     |
| InceptionResNetV2 | 92.41 %     |

## Dataset :
> DataSet and Challenge Link : https://www.hackerearth.com/challenges/competitive/hackerearth-deep-learning-challenge-holidays/

> The dataset consists of over 6000 images.

The benefits of practicing this problem by using Machine Learning/Deep Learning techniques are as follows:

* This challenge encourages you to apply your Deep Learning skills to build a model that classifies an image based on holiday-related elements.
* This challenge will help you to enhance your knowledge of multi-label classification, which is one of the basic building blocks of Machine Learning.
