## My Predictions :
> Used differnet transfer learning techniques to train the data

| MODELS            | ACCURACY(%) |
| ---               | ---         |
| MobileNetV2       | 88.40 %     |
| InceptionV3       | 89.92 %     |
| VGG16             | 77.64 %     |
| ResNet            | 86.60 %     |
| InceptionResNetV2 | 92.41 %     | 
| NASNetLarge       | 91.92 %     |

## Dataset :
> DataSet and Challenge Link : https://www.hackerearth.com/challenges/competitive/hackerearth-deep-learning-challenge-holidays/

> The dataset consists of over 6000 images.

The benefits of practicing this problem by using Machine Learning/Deep Learning techniques are as follows:

* This challenge encourages you to apply your Deep Learning skills to build a model that classifies an image based on holiday-related elements.
* This challenge will help you to enhance your knowledge of multi-label classification, which is one of the basic building blocks of Machine Learning.


## Problem statement :
> You work for a social media platform. Your task is to create a solution using deep learning to discern whether a post is holiday-related in an effort to better monetize the platform.

You are given the following six categories. You are required to classify the images in the dataset based on these categories.

* Miscellaneous
* Christmas_Tree
* Jacket
* Candle
* Airplane
* Snowman

## Data description :

This data set consists of the following two columns:

|   Column Name  | Description      |
| ---            | ---              |
| Image          | Name of image    |
| Class          | Category of image|

The data folder consists of two folders and one .csv file. The details are as follows:

* train: Contains 6469 images for 6 classes
* test: Contains 3489 images
* train.csv: 3489 x 2

## Evaluation metric :
''' score = 100* f1\_score(actual\_values,predicted\_values,average = 'weighted') 
'''
